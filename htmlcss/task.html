Atque unde saepe, quia praesentium impedit, reprehenderit optio, temporibus id totam soluta tempora nobis voluptatibus eveniet officia voluptates quo voluptatum qui dolores? There’s nothing worse than staring at a blank document on your screen.

            But think how easy it is to conquer that blank page. All you have to do is type one simple sentence.
            
            This maxim, “To begin is to succeed,” can be applied to every single writing project you take on. While the first sentence you create might not survive your editing process, it’s a start. Before you know it, that first sentence will grow into three, and then into whole paragraphs, and then to a full page.
            
            Keep in mind that your understanding of the task may be crippling your motivation. You’ll be more likely to procrastinate if the project seems ambiguous, unstructured, lacking in personal meaning, or without any intrinsic value.
            
            Determine if these or any other triggers might be inhibiting your creative process. Is the task disorganized? Work with your editor or client to gain a clearer understanding. With a revitalized set of expectations, you can begin on your path to success.</p>
